# business4s

Business4s is an organization intended to host projects adhering to the following design principles:
* **Business Oriented** - Solving real world problems in a way that directly benefits business and their requirements.
  This means solutions might be inspired by things like DDD, BPMN, DMN and other tools and techniques that focus on the business domain and on a close collaboration between engineering and business. 
* **Scala Code Driven** - Problems are solved using Scala language, meaning no XML, json or other formats that are typically present in similar tools.
  The code itself has to follow core Scala design principles, be functional, typesafe and possibly leverage a mix of functional and object oriented programming.
* **Simple** - While the code might leverage more advanced Scala features, the projects should be predictable, easy to understand,have minimal API surface and generally be as much non-magical as possible.
